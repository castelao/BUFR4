1001,BUFR,242000,Define conditioning event,(see Note 19).,19,"An event, as defined for use with operators 2 41 000 and 2 42 000, is a set of one or more circumstances described using appropriate Table B descriptors along with their corresponding data values. The grouping of such descriptors together as a single ""event"" allows them to be collectively assigned as the target of a separate descriptor such as 0 33 045 or 0 33 046. When defining a circumstance within an event, descriptor 0 33 042 may be employed preceding the appropriate Table B descriptor in order to indicate that the corresponding value is actually a bound for a range of values.",element,
1002,BUFR,243000,Categorical forecast values follow,(see Note 20).,20,"A categorical forecast value represents a ""best guess"" from among a set of related, and often mutually exclusive, data values or categories. Operator 2 43 000 may be used to designate one or more values as categorical forecast values, and descriptor 0 33 042 may be employed preceding any such value in order to indicate that that value is actually a bound for a range of values",element,

1010,BUFR,n/a,n/a,n/a,3,Cancellation of the use of the redefined value shall be effected by the inclusion of the appropriate operand with Y set to 0. The value shall then revert to the original Table B value.,table,
1011,BUFR,207YYY,"Increase scale, reference value and data width",n/a,4,"Nesting of operator descriptors must guarantee unambiguous interpretation.

1012,BUFR,204YYY,Add associated field,n/a,5,Nesting of the operator descriptor 2 04 is defined such that:(a) Each new definition adds to the currently defined associated field.

1016,BUFR,204YYY,Add associated field,n/a,9,"Once an associated field has been established and given meaning, the meaning may be changed by are-application of descriptor 0 31 021. The associated field needs not to be cancelled in order to change the meaning. Further, if an associated field is cancelled, and then re-established, it must be given a meaning by a proper application of the 0 31 021 descriptor, as described in Notes 5 to 8, i.e. a previous assignment of meaning does not remain in force when the associated field is cancelled.",element,

If multiple replacements for the same data element are to be included, they shall be ordered such that the original datum shall be last, the first replacement shall precede it, the next precede that, etc. Each (set of) replaced/retained data values shall be indicated by the inclusion of the 2 32 000 operator.",element,
