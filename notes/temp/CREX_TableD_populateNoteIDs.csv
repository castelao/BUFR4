00,n/a,n/a,(see Note 1),5,"It could be argued that, as only additions are possible, only complete lines should be allowed; but it is conceivable that local areas will require changes as well as additions, so it is better and in any case clearer to provide descriptions for all the fields."
00,n/a,n/a,(see Note 2),6,"It is better to use different Class 00 descriptors for the defining and defined elements, in the same way as different descriptors correspond to pressure considered as a coordinate and pressure measured at a given point; otherwise special rules would be needed to interpret such message. Entries B 00 010 to B 00 012 define F, X and Y for Tables B and D; entry B 00 030 is a descriptor used as data and provides the F, X and Y values defining a sequence for Table D entries."
00,n/a,n/a,(see Note 3),10,These entries include the facility to update the Table A code figure and data description.
01,D01027,R01000,(see Note 5),11,"This replication factor shall have a value of ""1"" when a 2-D feature is being described, whereas 3-D features may be described via any one of the following methods: (a) Via two or more horizontal sections in successive ascending flight levels. In this case, each section shall be described by an identical number of latitude/longitude points listed in identical order (i.e. where each point x of section n is to be joined via a straight line to point x of section n+1), in order to ensure that the overall shape of the 3-D feature is unambiguously described. In this case, all values reported for B 33 042 shall be ""missing"". (b) Via a single horizontal section with an appropriate value reported for B 33 042, as follows. In all such cases,the corresponding horizontal section description applies throughout the entire region. (i) A value of ""0"" to indicate a region above (but not including) the reported flight level and with unspecified upper bound. (ii) A value of ""1"" to indicate a region above (and including) the reported flight level and with unspecified upper bound. ( iii) A value of ""2"" to indicate a region below (but not including) the reported flight level and extending to the surface. (iv) A value of ""3"" to indicate a region below (and including) the reported flight level and extending to the surface. (c) Via two replications of the same horizontal section at the same reported flight level, in order to indicate a region extending both below and above (and including!) the reported flight level. In this case, the values reported for the two replications of B 33 042 shall be as follows:(i) Values of ""3"" and ""1"", respectively, to indicate a region beginning from below a reported flightlevel, but continuing through that level upward to some unspecified point above (e.g. TOP ABVFL100). (ii) Values of ""1"" and ""3"", respectively, to indicate a region beginning from above a reported flightlevel, but continuing through that level downward to some unspecified point below (e.g. CIGSBLW FL010)."
